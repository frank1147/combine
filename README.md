# Combine

This is my own implementation of the Combine app demoed by
[Jonas Gebhardt](https://twitter.com/jonasgebhardt) in his React Europe 2016
talk [Evolving the Visual Programming Environment with React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjJdaDXN5Vs).
Credit to Jonas for the ideas. I thought the concepts seemed fun, both to
implement and use, and wanted to take a stab at it.
